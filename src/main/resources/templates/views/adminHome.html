      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>On behalf of the Board, I am honoured to announce George McGregor as our new Executive Director for Next Step
        Ministries (NSM). George has been an active Board member since 2010, when he started as treasurer and then
        became Board Chair in 2018.

        Earlier this year, upon retirement of NSM Founder Phil Reimer, George was appointed as Interim Executive
        Director and transitioned into the full-time Executive Director role September 1.

        George is a Pastor who brings a strong people-focused approach, business acumen, and a thoughtful leadership
        style to NSM, and we are excited to see him lead and grow this ministry in the years ahead.

        Join us as we welcome George into his new role</p>
